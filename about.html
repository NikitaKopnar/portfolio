                        I'm Nikita, born on October 15, in Yavatmal, Maharashtra, India, my beloved hometown.

                        From my early years, I was determined to pursue a BTech degree, and I embarked on a journey of dedication and hard work to achieve this goal. I completed my SSC and then pursued a diploma in computer engineering.
                        During my diploma studies, I delved into various projects involving Android, Java-based, and web applications. After successfully completing my diploma, I enrolled in a BTech program at Shri Guru Gobind Singhji Institute of Engineering and Technology in Nanded, Maharashtra. Throughout my degree, I remained passionately committed to my career goals, balancing project design with preparation for my first job in a multinational company.
                        <br><br>My efforts paid off when I secured a position at HCLTech, where I currently serve as a software engineer. As a web developer, I consistently strive for excellence, leveraging my strong command of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular.
